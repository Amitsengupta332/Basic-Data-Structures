in complexity array  singly double the operation are same in :
insert an any position, delete at any position and insert a tail.

insert at head ==> array are bad, singly and doubly better.
delete at head ==>  array are bad, singly and doubly better.
delete at tail ==> singly are bad, array and doubly better.


N.B => doubly are always Better.
